## About CollapseLoader

CollapseLoader is an open-source GUI utility designed to securely launch Minecraft cheat clients on Windows and Linux. Built with Rust and Tauri, it prioritizes safety, transparency, and ease of use. Key features include:

- **Secure Client Management**: Only thoroughly vetted clients are supported, ensuring a safe experience.
- **Open-Source Transparency**: All code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Latyxxx/CollapseLoader/) for community review.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows and Linux.
- **Virus-Free Guarantee**: Every client and build is scanned for malware using advanced tools and VirusTotal.

## Why CollapseLoader is Safe

CollapseLoader is designed with security as a top priority. Here’s why you can trust it:

- **Fully Open-Source**: All components, including the launcher, API, and Discord bot, are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Latyxxx/CollapseLoader/releases/tag/0.1.6) for public auditing.
- **Rigorous Client Verification**: Each client is tested using virtual machines, decompilers, debuggers, and VirusTotal to ensure it’s free of malware.
- **No Obfuscation**: Clients with protectors like VMProtect or Themida are prohibited, and CollapseLoader’s code is free of obfuscation for full transparency.


> **Note**: While CollapseLoader ensures maximum safety, always exercise caution with cheat clients, as they carry inherent risks. Download only from official sources.

For more details, see our [Security Overview](SECURITY.md).
